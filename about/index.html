    Rubick the Grand Magus is a ranged Intelligence hero
    best known for his ability to copy the spells of his
    enemies and use them as his own. Although he is mostly
    played as a support and is extremely fragile the entire
    length of the game, he can still prove to be one of the
    most influential heroes if he utilizes good positioning
    and well-timed usage of his ultimate, Spell Steal. Spell
    Steal allows Rubick to cast an enemy hero's most recently
    used spell, giving him supreme versatility throughout the
    game. By stealing the right abilities, the Grand Magus can
    aid himself and allies by casting crippling disables,
    applying curses, unleashing powerful nukes, disorienting
    the enemy team, supporting his allies with buffs, escaping
    from rough situations, or even enhancing his own physical attacks.
    His other abilities are just as worthy of a Magus: Telekinesis
    lets Rubick magically lift an enemy into the air, rendering the target helpless and vulnerable, before hurling the lifted enemy to the ground up to a short distance away and stunning nearby foes on impact. Fade Bolt blasts enemies with a stream of arcane energy which bounces to all enemies nearby, dealing damage and reducing their attack damage. Null Field is a passive aura, which grants himself and nearby allies bonus magic resistance to shrug off magical assaults. Rubick's versatile ability-set and his infamous Spell Steal make him a flexible and powerful hero that can work in any lineup although he does suffer from long cool-downs and the surfacing predictability of his ultimate.
